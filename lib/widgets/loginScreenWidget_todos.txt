Todo Comments: You have several //todo comments in your code. While it's good to have reminders, it's essential to track them properly. Consider using a task management system or IDE extensions/plugins that can manage these tasks more effectively.

State Management: You're using a loggedIn boolean to track the login status. However, this approach may not be sufficient for more complex applications. Consider using a state management solution like Provider, Riverpod, or Bloc to manage the application state more effectively.

Error Handling: Make sure to handle exceptions and errors more gracefully. For example, in _handleRegistration, if an exception occurs during registration, you should catch it and display a user-friendly error message.

Code Organization: Your code is relatively long and contains a mix of UI and logic. Consider separating your UI code from your business logic using widgets and classes. This will make your code more maintainable and testable.

Repetition: There's some repetition in your code, especially in the _handleSignup, _handleRegistration, and _handleLogin methods. You can refactor these methods to reduce duplication.

Async/Await: Ensure that you're using async/await consistently and correctly in asynchronous methods. For example, in _handleSocialLogin, you should use await when calling socialAuth.handleSignIn.

Navigation: Consider using named routes for navigation instead of creating new instances of MaterialPageRoute every time. Named routes make it easier to manage navigation and pass data between screens.

Dependency Injection: You're using getIt for dependency injection, which is good. Ensure that you're registering your dependencies correctly and handling any exceptions that may arise during the injection process.

TextEditingController Disposal: Make sure to dispose of your TextEditingController instances when they are no longer needed to prevent memory leaks. You can do this by calling dispose in the dispose method of your StatefulWidget.

Security: Ensure that you handle user authentication and password storage securely, especially if this code is used in a production environment. Consider using packages like flutter_secure_storage for secure storage of sensitive data.

Testing: Write unit tests for your business logic, especially the registration and login logic, to ensure that they work as expected under various scenarios.
