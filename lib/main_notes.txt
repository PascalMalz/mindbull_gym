Here are some factors to consider when deciding whether to reuse instances of a class like RegistrationAPI:

Statelessness: If RegistrationAPI doesn't maintain any internal state or data between method calls, it's likely safe to reuse the same instance.

Thread Safety: Ensure that RegistrationAPI methods are thread-safe if your application uses multiple threads or isolates.

Dependency Lifecycles: Consider the lifecycle of the dependencies of RegistrationAPI. For instance, if RegistrationAPI depends on a database connection or other resources, ensure that those dependencies are managed properly.

Configuration: If RegistrationAPI requires different configurations or settings for different parts of your application, you might need to create multiple instances with different configurations.

Testing: In unit testing, it can be beneficial to create fresh instances of RegistrationAPI for each test case to isolate them from each other. Dependency injection frameworks like GetIt can help manage these instances during testing.
