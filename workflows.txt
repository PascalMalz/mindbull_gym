#To update your development branch from the changes you've made locally in VS Code, and then update the main branch, follow these steps:
# Step 1: Stage and commit changes on development
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"

# Step 2: Push development changes
git push origin development

# Step 3: Switch to main
git checkout main

# Step 4: Pull latest main (optional, but safe)
git pull origin main

# Step 5: Merge development into main
git merge development

# Step 6: Push the updated main
git push origin main



in short:
git add .
git commit -m "All Exercise Tabs filled with exercises"
git push origin development
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge development
git push origin main

Gi back to development:
git checkout development
git merge main
